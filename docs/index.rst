Welcome to the SIMP documentation!
==================================

This is the documentation for the |simp_version| release of SIMP, which is
compatible with CentOS and Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL).  This guide will
walk a user through the process of installing and managing a :term:`SIMP`
system.  It also provides a mapping of security features to security
requirements, which can be used to document a system's security conformance.
